# fep_prepare
This is for myself for the purpose of NAMD fep simulation input preparation, after the web server call "Feprepare"

Download this repository, then go to Feprepare to generate your files.zip and put it inside the fep_prepare folder.

There is an example files.zip (actually a tgz file), in your calculation, you should change this to your input of interest.

run the "./1.sh" command to modify the conf files.
run the "2.1.pbs" command in a cluster 
or 
run the "2.2.sh" in a local or AI studio (colab) platform
