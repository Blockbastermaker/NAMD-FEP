# NAMD-fep

Download the step by step pdf tutorial for more details.

You don't have to look at 1.sh or lambda.txr, as well as the paramter_ptach.txt unless you want to know how the namd configuration files were modified. The thing you need to run Fep is the toppar.zip file, and the namd conf file.  You need to modify forward conf to make a backward one by yourself to run a complete simulation.
